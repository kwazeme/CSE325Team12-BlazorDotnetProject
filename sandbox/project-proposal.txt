1. Title: PropertyHub - Propoerty Rental Management System

2. Project Overview

The application provides property owners with a centralized system to organize listing information, tenant details, and lease agreements. 
Users can perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on listings, tenants, and leases—fundamental operations that showcase the capabilities of the Blazor framework.

Problem Statement
Property owners need a simple way to organize and track their rental listings and tenant information without using spreadsheets or multiple disconnected tools.

 Target Users
  Small listing owners managing 1-5 rental units
  listing managers needing to track listing and tenant information

   
3. Project Scope

What's IN
Core Features:
•	User authentication (login/register for listing owners)
•	listing management (add, view, edit, delete listings with address and rent amount)
•	Tenant management (add, view, edit, delete tenant information)
•	Lease management (create leases linking tenants to listings with start/end dates)
•	Simple listing list dashboard
•	Responsive design for desktop and mobile
•	Form validation

 What's OUT
•	Role based authorization (single owner role only)
•	Rent payment tracking
•	Email notifications
•	Advanced reporting or analytics
•	Tenant screening
•	Payment processing
•	Multi user access or listing sharing
•	Mobile app (web only, but responsive)

4. App Features

 Core Features (User Actions)

1. User Registration & Authentication
•	Users can create an account with email and password
•	Users can log in with existing credentials
•	Users remain logged in during their session
•	User Story: "As a listing owner, I want to create an account and log in so that my listing data is private."

2. listing Management (CRUD)
•	Users can add new listings (address, city, state, rent amount, listing type)
•	Users can view a list of all their listings
•	Users can view details of individual listings
•	Users can edit listing information
•	Users can delete listings
•	User Story: "As a listing owner, I want to add and organize my rental listings so that I can keep track of them."

3. Tenant Management (CRUD)
•	Users can add tenant information (name, email, phone number)
•	Users can view a list of all tenants
•	Users can view individual tenant details
•	Users can edit tenant information
•	Users can delete tenant records
•	User Story: "As a listing owner, I want to maintain a list of my tenants with their contact information."

4. Lease Management (CRUD)
•	Users can create leases by selecting a listing and tenant
•	Users can specify lease start and end dates
•	Users can view all active and inactive leases
•	Users can view lease details
•	Users can edit lease information
•	Users can delete/end leases
•	User Story: "As a listing owner, I want to track which tenant rents which listing and when their lease ends."

5. Technical Considerations

Data Storage
•	User data: Name, email, phone number, address, password
•	listing data: Address, city, state, listing type, rent amount
•	Tenant data: Name, email, phone number
•	Lease data: listing ID, Tenant ID, lease start date, lease end date
•	Database: SQLite with Entity Framework Core for ORM

 User Accounts & Authentication
•	Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity with email/password registration and login
•	Authorization: All users have the same permissions (single user role)
•	Security: Passwords hashed with ASP.NET Core Identity

 External Services
•	None for now
•	Future enhancements for map API

 Device Compatibility
•	Desktop & Tablet: Responsive design using Bootstrap
•	Mobile: Touch friendly responsive interface
•	Browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari

 Basic Security
•	Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity handles secure password hashing
•	Data Validation: Server-side validation to prevent invalid input and SQL injection
•	HTTPS: Required for deployed applications
•	Access Control: Users only see their own listings and tenants
