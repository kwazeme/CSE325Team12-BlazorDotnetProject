1. Title
PropertyHub - Property Rental Management System

2. Project Overview
The application provides property owners with a centralized system to organize listing information, tenant details, and lease agreements. Users can perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on listings, tenants, and leases. This showcases core capabilities of the Blazor framework.

Problem Statement
Property owners need a simple way to organize and track their rental listings and tenant information without using spreadsheets or multiple disconnected tools.

Target Users
- Small property owners managing 1-5 rental units
- Property managers needing to track listing and tenant information

3. Project Scope

What's IN (Core Features)
- User authentication (login/register for property owners)
- Listing management (add, view, edit, delete listings with address and rent amount)
- Tenant management (add, view, edit, delete tenant information)
- Lease management (create leases linking tenants to listings with start/end dates)
- Simple listings dashboard
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Form validation

What's OUT
- Role-based authorization (single owner role only)
- Rent payment tracking
- Email notifications
- Advanced reporting or analytics
- Tenant screening
- Payment processing
- Multi-user access or listing sharing
- Mobile app (web only, but responsive)

4. App Features (User Actions)

1. User Registration & Authentication
- Users can create an account with email and password
- Users can log in with existing credentials
- Users remain logged in during their session
- User Story: "As a property owner, I want to create an account and log in so that my listing data is private."

2. Listing Management (CRUD)
- Users can add new listings (address, city, state, rent amount, listing type)
- Users can view a list of all their listings
- Users can view details of individual listings
- Users can edit listing information
- Users can delete listings
- User Story: "As a property owner, I want to add and organize my rental listings so that I can keep track of them."

3. Tenant Management (CRUD)
- Users can add tenant information (name, email, phone number)
- Users can view a list of all tenants
- Users can view individual tenant details
- Users can edit tenant information
- Users can delete tenant records
- User Story: "As a property owner, I want to maintain a list of my tenants with their contact information."

4. Lease Management (CRUD)
- Users can create leases by selecting a listing and tenant
- Users can specify lease start and end dates
- Users can view all active and inactive leases
- Users can view lease details
- Users can edit lease information
- Users can delete/end leases
- User Story: "As a property owner, I want to track which tenant rents which listing and when their lease ends."

5. Technical Considerations

Data Storage
- User data: name, email, phone number, address, password (hashed by Identity)
- Listing data: address, city, state, listing type, rent amount
- Tenant data: name, email, phone number
- Lease data: listing ID, tenant ID, lease start date, lease end date
- Database: SQLite with Entity Framework Core for ORM

User Accounts & Authentication
- Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity with email/password registration and login
- Authorization: All users have the same permissions (single owner role)
- Security: Passwords hashed with ASP.NET Core Identity

External Services
- None for now
- Future enhancements: map API

Device Compatibility
- Desktop & Tablet: Responsive design using Bootstrap
- Mobile: Touch-friendly responsive interface
- Browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari

Basic Security
- Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity handles secure password hashing
- Data Validation: server-side validation to prevent invalid input and SQL injection
- HTTPS: required for deployed applications
- Access Control: users only see their own listings and tenants

6. Quality, Accessibility, and Standards (Added to meet course requirements)

Performance
- Optimize data transfer by loading only the necessary fields per page
- Avoid unnecessary database calls and use async queries

Validation
- Use built-in Blazor validation attributes and server-side checks
- Verify HTML/CSS validity using standard validators

Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Use semantic HTML, labels, and ARIA where needed
- Ensure color contrast meets AA requirements
- Provide keyboard navigation for all forms and menus

Usability
- Clear navigation with consistent placement
- Simple, readable forms with validation messages
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Branding
- Consistent color scheme, typography, and layout

Navigation
- Logical hierarchy: Home, Listings, Tenants, Leases, Account
- Consistent navigation menu across pages

Testing and QA
- Manual testing of all CRUD paths
- Authentication tests (register, login, logout)
- Validation tests for required fields and invalid formats
- Responsive testing on mobile and desktop

Documentation
- Code comments for non-obvious logic
- Basic start and use guide for end users
